# Tour du Mont Blanc
`tmb` is a Python application to help you plan your Tour du Mont Blanc (TMB) hike.

Most refuges on the TMB list their availability on https://www.montourdumontblanc.com, but the website is a little bit hard to navigate.
I built a simple dashboard that displays the availability for all huts.
The data is updated once a day at 8AM UTC.
