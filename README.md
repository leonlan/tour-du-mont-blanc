# Tour du Mont Blanc
`tmb` is a Python application to help you plan your Tour du Mont Blanc (TMB) hike.

Most refuges on the TMB list their availability on https://www.montourdumontblanc.com, but the website is a little bit hard to navigate.
Instead, I made a dashboard that show  the availability of all refuges, in a simple calendar view.
The dashboard can be found at https://leonlan.shinyapps.io/dashboard/ and the availability information is updated on a daily basis.
    
## Notes about the TMB
- Not all refuges on the TMB have their availability listed on https://www.montourdumontblanc.com.
- If you follow the standard TMB stages, most of the popular refuges are already fully booked by November. You will need to plan an itinerary that doesn't follow the classic TMB stages. See https://tourdumontblanchike.com/tour-du-mont-blanc-etapes-stages/ for more information about the stages.
