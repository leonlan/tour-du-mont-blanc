# Tour du Mont Blanc
`tmb` is a Python application to help you plan your Tour du Mont Blanc (TMB) hike.

Most refuges on the TMB list their availability on https://www.montourdumontblanc.com, but the website is a little bit hard to navigate.
I built a simple script that fetches the availability for all huts.
    
## Notes about the TMB
- Not all refuges on the TMB have their availability listed on https://www.montourdumontblanc.com.
- If you follow the standard TMB stages, most of the popular refuges are already fully booked by November. You will need to plan an itinerary that doesn't follow the classic TMB stages. See https://tourdumontblanchike.com/tour-du-mont-blanc-etapes-stages/ for more information about the stages.
